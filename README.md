A FILE HANDLING UTILITY is a software tool that provides various functions for managing and manipulating files. Some common features of a file handling utility include:
FILE CREATION:-Creating new files with specified names and extensions.
FILE READING:-Reading the contents of existing files.
FILE WRITING:-Writing data to files,either by overwriting existing content or appending new content.
FILE MODIFICATION:-Modifying the contents of existing files , such as replacing specific text or inserting new data.
FILE DELETION:-Deleting files that are no longer needed.
FILE COPYING:-Copying files from one location to another.
FILE MOVING :- Moving files from one location to another.

USAGE:
Run the program and enter the file path when prompted.
Enter the content to write to the file when prompted.
The program will display the file content after writing.
Enter the content to append to the file when prompted.
The program will display the file content after appending.
Enter the old content to replace and the new content when prompted.
The programing will display the file content after modification.

TOOLS:
JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: The programming is written in JAVA ,which provides a robust and efficient way to perform file operations.
FileWriter Class:The FileWriter class is used to write content to a file.
FILES CLASS:The Files class is used to read content from a file.
SCANNER CLASS:The Scanner class is used to get user input from the console.
JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT(JDK):The JDK is used to compile and run the Java program.
INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT(IDE):An IDE such as Visual Studio Code  used to Write ,compile and run the java program.
